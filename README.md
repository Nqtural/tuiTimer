# tuiTimer
tuiTimer is a speedcubing timer inspired by csTimer but in a TUI.

**THIS PROJECT IS IN VERY EARLY BETA AND THERE WILL PROBABLY BE MANY BUGS**

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Nqtural/tuiTimer/
cd tuiTimer
python main.py
```

## Configuration
Currently, there are no ways of configuring this program. There will be configuration options later.

## Usage
* `F1`, `F2`, `F3` for switching tabs.
* Hold `space` in the timer tab until timer turns green and then release to start timer. Stop by pressing `space` again.
* Press `ctrl` + `c` to exit
* Arrow keys `left` and `right` switches to the previous and next algorithm page respectively. `space` and arrow keys `up` and `down` switches between OLL and PLL algorithms.
